Attention In order to migrate to v2 and v3 from v1 it is advised to follow this guide: Migrating from V1 . Library Versions \u00b6 Currently there are 3 active versions of the controls. Please, reference the table below to see what version to use in your project. Version SPFx minimal dependency Fluent UI (Office UI Fabric React) version SharePoint Version Comments v3 1.13.* 7.174.1 Online The most current, actively maintained version of the library. v2 1.11.0 6.214.0 Online The version deprecated and not actively maintained. We strongly recommend to update to SPFx 1.13.* and v3 of Controls. v1 1.3.0 5.131.0 On-Prem The version is maintained for SharePoint On-Prem 2016 and 2019 implementations. Be aware that the controls might not work in solutions you're building for on-premises. As for on-premises solutions version 1.1.0 will get used. Attention If you are using v3 of the Controls with SPFx 1.12.1 you will need to cast web part context to any to pass it to the controls. Getting started \u00b6 Installation \u00b6 To get started you have to install the following dependency to your project: @pnp/spfx-property-controls . Enter the following command to install the dependency to your project: npm install @pnp/spfx-property-controls --save --save-exact Configuration \u00b6 Note Since v1.7.0 the localized resource path will automatically be configured during the dependency installing. Once the package is installed, you will have to configure the resource file of the property controls to be used in your project. You can do this by opening the config/config.json and adding the following line to the localizedResources property: \"PropertyControlStrings\" : \"node_modules/@pnp/spfx-property-controls/lib/loc/{locale}.js\" Telemetry \u00b6 All controls gather telemetry to verify the usage. Only the name of the control and related data gets captured. More information about the service that we are using for this can be found here: PnP Telemetry Proxy . Since version 1.17.0 it is possible to opt-out of the telemetry by adding the following code to your web part: import PnPTelemetry from \"@pnp/telemetry-js\" ; ... const telemetry = PnPTelemetry . getInstance (); telemetry . optOut (); Controls \u00b6 The following controls are currently available: PropertyFieldBrandFontPicker (Property pane Brand Center font selector) PropertyFieldButton (Property pane Button) PropertyFieldCodeEditor (Property pane code editor) PropertyFieldCollectionData (Property pane collection data editor) PropertyFieldColorPicker (Property pane color picker) PropertyFieldColumnPicker (Property pane list column picker) PropertyFieldDateTimePicker (Property pane date and time selector) PropertyFieldFilePicker (Property pane file picker) PropertyFieldFolderPicker (Property pane folder picker) PropertyFieldGrid (Property pane Grid control) PropertyFieldGuid (Property pane GUID editor) PropertyFieldIconPicker (Property pane icon picker) PropertyFieldListPicker (Property pane list selector) PropertyFieldMessage (Property pane message) PropertyFieldMonacoEditor (Property pane Monaco Editor) PropertyFieldMultiSelect (Property pane multi select dropdown) PropertyFieldNumber (Property pane number editor) PropertyFieldOrder (Property pane ordered list editor) PropertyFieldPassword (Property pane password editor) PropertyFieldPeoplePicker (Property pane people / group selector) PropertyFieldRoleDefinitionPicker (Property pane role definition picker) PropertyFieldSearch (Property pane search box) PropertyFieldSitePicker (Property pane site selector) PropertyFieldSpinButton (Property pane spin button) PropertyFieldSpinner (Property pane spinner) PropertyFieldSwatchColorPicker (Property pane color selector) PropertyFieldTeamPicker (Property pane team selector) PropertyFieldTermPicker (Property pane managed metadata term selector) PropertyFieldEnterpriseTermPicker (Property pane managed metadata term selector for enterprise scenarios) PropertyFieldViewPicker (Property pane view selector) PropertyPaneMarkdownContent (Property pane markdown content) PropertyPanePropertyEditor (Property pane control that allows raw editing, export and import of webpart properties) PropertyPaneWebPartInformation (Property pane webpart information panel) The following controls are extended controls that show a callout next to the label PropertyFieldButtonWithCallout (Property button field with callout) PropertyFieldCheckboxWithCallout (Property checkbox field with callout) PropertyFieldChoiceGroupWithCallout (Property choice group field with callout) PropertyFieldDropdownWithCallout (Property dropdown field with callout) PropertyFieldLabelWithCallout (Property label field with callout) PropertyFieldLinkWithCallout (Property link field with callout) PropertyFieldSliderWithCallout (Property slider field with callout) PropertyFieldTextWithCallout (Property text field with callout) PropertyFieldToggleWithCallout (Property toggle field with callout)","title":"Home"},{"location":"#reusable-property-pane-controls-for-the-sharepoint-framework-solutions","text":"This repository provides developers with a set of reusable property pane controls that can be used in their SharePoint Framework (SPFx) solutions.

It loads term sets and terms on demand - only at the moment when specified group or term set has been expanded in the Term Store Tree. To implement on-demand loading PropertyFieldEnterpriseTermPicker uses @pnp/sp-taxonomy module from @pnp/pnpjs library. It increases the size of a bundle when the control is used. Additionally, PropertyFieldEnterpriseTermPicker allows to request labels for the terms in the picker. PropertyFieldTermPicker loads all the groups and term sets from the term service during the initial request. This approach fits most of the scenarios with small and medium number of objects in a term store. Besides that, PropertyFieldTermPicker does not use any additional libraries or modules to retrieve data from the taxonomy service which makes it much more lightweight option in comparison with PropertyFieldEnterpriseTermPicker .

You can use this control to easily provide guidance for your users and create other content that is not easily created otherwise. It supports any arbitrary HTML without using dangerouslySetInnerHTML , and allows overriding any HTML tag. PropertyPaneMarkdownContent rendering How to use this control in your solutions \u00b6 Check that you installed the @pnp/spfx-property-controls dependency. Check out The getting started page for more information about installing the dependency. Import the following modules to your component: import { PropertyPaneMarkdownContent } from '@pnp/spfx-property-controls/lib/PropertyPaneMarkdownContent' ; Create a string with Markdown content for your property pane, for example: const md : string = ` ### This is Markdown [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) lets you write content in a really natural way. * You can have lists, like this one * Make things **bold** or *italic* * Embed snippets of \\`code\\` * Create [links](/) * ... Also supports GitHub-flavored Markdown checklists - [x] Checklist item 1 - [x] Checklist item 2 - [ ] Checklist item 3 <small>Sample content borrowed with thanks from [markdown-to-jsx](https://probablyup.com/markdown-to-jsx/) \u2764\ufe0f</small>` Add the custom property control to the groupFields of the web part property pane configuration: PropertyPaneMarkdownContent ({ markdown : md , key : 'markdownSample' }) Indentation \u00b6 Pay close attention to the indentation in your Markdown string. The Markdown parser assumes that four spaces preceding your content means a code block. This means that the following Markdown will render most of the content a code block: const md : string = ` To get started select an items from the library. You can pick any items from the list, provided that is has a valid \\`id\\` attribute.` Producing the following HTML: To solve this issue, make sure that your content is not indented. const md : string = `To get started select an items from the library. You can pick any items from the list, provided that is has a valid \\`id\\` attribute.` Which will produce the following HTML: Overriding rendering of HTML elements \u00b6 You can override the rendering of any HTML element by specifying an overrides prop to the options . For example, to override the CSS class of H3 elements (which is defined by a ### in Markdown), you can override the className attribute using the following code: PropertyPaneMarkdownContent ({ markdown : ` ### This is a heading 3 You can override any HTML you want` , key : 'markdownSample' , options : { overrides : { h3 : { // Markdown equivalent of ### props : { className : \"ms-font-xl ms-fontColor-neutralDark\" , }, }, } }}), You can also render your own React elements using the overrides prop. For example, if you have a MyCustomControl React element, you can use the following: // Import your React element import MyCustomControl from 'MyCustomControl' ; ... PropertyPaneMarkdownContent ({ markdown : ` ### This is a heading 3 You can override any HTML you want <MyCustomControl sampleMessage='This is a sample message'/> ` , key : 'markdownSample' , options : { overrides : { h3 : { // Markdown equivalent of ### props : { className : \"ms-font-xl ms-fontColor-neutralDark\" , }, }, // Override the React element MyCustomControl : MyCustomControl } }}), Rendering all elements as inline or block elements \u00b6 By default, the control will attempt to determine whether the Markdown content should be wrapped in a <div> , <p> , or <span> to render content as block or inline elements.

Look no further: # assuming you are in the folder of your locally cloned fork.... git checkout dev # assuming you have a remote named `upstream` pointing to the official **sp-dev-fx-property-controls** repo git fetch upstream # update your local dev branch to be a mirror of what's in the main repo git pull --rebase upstream dev # switch to your branch where you are working, say \"issue-xyz\" git checkout issue-xyz # update your branch to update its fork point to the current tip of dev & put your changes on top of it git rebase dev Submit PR to the dev branch of the main repo. PRs submitted to other branches will be declined Let us know what's in the PR: is it a new command, bug fix or a minor update in the docs? The clearer the information you provide, the quicker your PR can be verified and merged Ideally 1 PR = 1 commit - this makes it easier to keep the log clear for everyone and track what's changed. If you're new to working with git, we'll squash your commits for you when merging your changes into the main repo Don't worry about changing the version or adding yourself to the list of contributors in package.json . We'll do that for you when merging your changes.","title":"Submitting a PR"},{"location":"helpers/PropertyPaneHelpers/","text":"PropertyPaneHelpers \u00b6 These are helpers to interact with the property pane of the web part.
