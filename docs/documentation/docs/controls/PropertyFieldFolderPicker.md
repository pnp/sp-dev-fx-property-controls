# PropertyFieldFolderPicker control

This control allows you to explore and select a folder from the property pane.
It also allows the user to create a new folder at the current level being explored.

Here is an example of the control:

## How to use this control in your solutions

- Check that you installed the `@pnp/spfx-property-controls` dependency. Check out The [getting started](../../#getting-started) page for more information about installing the dependency.
- Import the following modules to your webpart:

```TypeScript
import { IFolder, IPropertyFieldFolderPickerProps , PropertyFieldFolderPicker } from "@pnp/spfx-property-controls/lib/PropertyFieldFolderPicker";
```

Create a new property for your web part, for example:

```TypeScript
export interface IPropertyControlsTestWebPartProps {
  folderPicker: IFolder;
}
```

- Add the folder picker property control to the `groupFields` of the web part property pane configuration:

```TypeScript
 PropertyFieldFolderPicker('folderPicker', {
    context: this.context,
    onPropertyChange: this.onPropertyPaneFieldChanged.bind(this),
    properties: this.properties,
    key: "folderPickerId",
    label: "Folder Picker",
    selectedFolder: this.properties.folderPicker,
    canCreateFolders: true,
    onSelect: ((folder: IFolder) => { console.log(folder); this.properties.folderPicker = folder; }),
    rootFolder: {
        Name: "Documents",
        ServerRelativeUrl: "/sites/testSiteCollection/Shared Documents"
    },
}),
```
